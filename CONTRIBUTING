Please feel free to make pull/merge requests to this project!

Guidelines are pretty simple:

1. Make sure tests still pass! You should be able to install pytest and run
the `pytest` command. If pysodium is upset about libsodium not being installed,
you will have to install it separately.

2. Add new tests to cover any new functionality or bugfixes.

3. We aren't doing a formal DCO anymore. If you make a pull request here, you are
certifying that the code you provided is yours to give, and you are licensing it under
the MIT license as in the pypaseto project.

4. Issue a pull request in github!

5. Be helpful with any questions/concerns/discussion about your contribution. Thank you!
